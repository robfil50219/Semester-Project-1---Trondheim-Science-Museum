          Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on
          down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn about
          Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in
          time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed
          to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure you come ready to
          learn and explore.<br />
          We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
          Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
          experiment with our team of experts. During the school holidays we run
          special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go
          on a journey of discovery. Each holiday we pick a new theme to
          explore. <br />
          To find out more about the holiday club and how you can join, send us

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to
              find out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring
              your students through for a visit.
